‚ú® Glitter Bomb ‚Äî A playful, powerful Linux info and system control toolkit by Patrick Indran.
Overview

Glitter Bomb is a set of bash scripts designed to extract system info, capture webcam and screen snapshots, and (for the daring) even ‚Äúnuke‚Äù your bootloader. It includes:

    Glitter Bomb Launcher: Simple, colorful interface to select and run available scripts.

    Info Extraction Script: Collects system stats, IP/geolocation, webcam photo, and screenshots.

    Nuke Script: Detects distro and bootloader, then safely removes the bootloader after multiple confirmations (EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ‚Äî use responsibly!).

    Modular, clean bash scripts with built-in colors and fun messages to brighten your terminal.

Features

    Detects Linux distro and bootloader type.

    Collects CPU, RAM, battery, Wi-Fi info.

    Captures webcam image (with a cheeky ‚ÄúMwahaha!‚Äù message).

    Takes full-screen screenshots (supports both Wayland and X11).

    Supports graceful fallbacks and displays image paths if inline display isn‚Äôt available.

    Self-destructing nuke script with 5-step confirmation.

    Uses absolute paths so you can move scripts without breaking them.

    Clone or copy the Glitter Bomb folder anywhere on your Linux system.

    Make sure dependencies are installed (e.g., curl, fswebcam, grim or scrot, nmcli).
